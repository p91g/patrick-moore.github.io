üßë‚Äçüíª I am a PhD candidate of Transportation Data Science

ü§ñ üó∫Ô∏è I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly geo-spatial data 

üö≤ I have a special interest in cycling research

üìö My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare use in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I have used. Hopefully others interested in the field find some of it useful!  

Interests
------
From p-values to deep learning, my experience in visualising, exploring and modelling data is wide-ranging. 

I have experience with web scraping and preprocessing large datasets. I've also honed my skills with interpreting statistical models, training machine learning (ML) models and applying optimisation algorithms. 

During my PhD, I applied statistical techniques that captured the complexities, including non-linear effects and spatial dependency, of data sampled across multiple cities to generate a single model. The purpose was to make statements applicable to other cities and to make reliable predictions for potential docking station locations. 

I am fascinated by the influence of the built environment on how we live in cities. I have developed spatial clusters that bring together indicators of land use and connectivity to describe urban morphology. These form a unique component of my research in explaining demand for bikeshare.  

To apply my predictive model results, I designed several optimisation solutions to allocate bikeshare stations. I used an evolutionary algorithm, incoporating built environment data to improve system efficiency and enhance user demand. 

I particularly enjoy bringing my data to life visually, whether that be a dashboard, an interactive map or exploring a plotting library. 

I've also had exposure non-transport projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning.

I generally spend equal time between R and Python, with Python typically used for ML and data wrangling and R for statistical modelling.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Transport Data Science after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.
