üßë‚Äçüíª I am a PhD candidate of Intelligent Transport Systems

ü§ñ üó∫Ô∏è I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly geo-spatial data 

üö≤ I have a special interest in cycling research

üìö My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare use in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I have used. Hopefully others interested in the field find some of it useful!  

Interests
------
I am nearing completion of a PhD in Intelligent Transport Systems, focusing on optimising bikeshare operations through analysis of the built environment. My research employs an integrated analytical framework comprising:
1. Statistical modelling to infer relationships between the built environment and bikeshare use.
2. Cluster analysis to categorise UK cities based on urban characteristics.
3. Machine learning to predict future bikeshare use patterns based on these city clusters.
4. Development of an optimisation approach to determine optimal station locations, aiming to control system dynamics and improve overall efficiency.

Through my PhD, I have nurtured a fascination with understanding the cities we live in, seeking out new ways to capture and analyse geo-spatial data. From performing graph analysis on road networks, to analysing the spatial distribution of buildings, or segmenting city space into distinct clusters, I find excitement in discovering the underlying structures of the urban environment and how people interact with it.

I particularly enjoy bringing data to life visually, whether that be a dashboard, an interactive map or exploring a plotting library. This passion for visualisation enhances my ability to communicate complex spatial patterns and relationships effectively.

While my focus is on transport systems, I've also had exposure to diverse projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning. This breadth of experience has enhanced my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

I primarily work with Python for geo-spatial data wrangling and machine learning, complemented by R for statistical modelling. This combination allows me to leverage the strengths of both languages to tackle different projects.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Intelligent Transport Systems after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.
