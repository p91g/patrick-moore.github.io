🧑‍💻 I am a PhD graduate of Transportation Data Science

🤖 🗺️ I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly spatial data 

🚲 I have a special interest in cycling research

📚 My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare demand in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I used to visualise, explore and analyse data. I hope that others interested in transportation data science find some of the explanations useful for their research!  

Interests
------
From p-values to deep learning, my experience in visualising, exploring and modelling data is wide-ranging. 

I have experience with web scraping and preprocessing large datasets. I'm also skilled at interpreting statistical models, training machine learning (ML) models and optimising complex search spaces. 

During my PhD, I developed an appreciation for versatile modeling techniques, which provided ample opportunities for experimentation. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) played a significant role in my research, particularly for inference purposes and in managing the intricacies of spatial data. I am fascinated with comparing the results of statistical models to ML algorithms, exploring both their accuracy and explainability.

In the practical application of my predictive models, I designed several optimization solutions for the placement of bikeshare stations. My approach involved the use of evolutionary algorithms, which resulted in innovative and efficient distribution strategies that significantly improved accessibility and user demand within bikeshare systems. 

I particularly enjoy bringing my data to life visually, whether that be a dashboard, an interactive map or exploring a plotting library. 

I've also had exposure non-transport projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning.

I generally spend equal time between R and Python, with Python typically used for ML and R for advanced statistical models.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Transport Data Science after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.  

Present
------
I am currently taking some time off after graduating, doing a bit of travelling, and exploring opportunities in the data science world shortly thereafter.
