üßë‚Äçüíª I am a PhD candidate of Intelligent Transport Systems

ü§ñ üó∫Ô∏è I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly geo-spatial data 

üö≤ I have a special interest in cycling research

üìö My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare use in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I have used. Hopefully others interested in the field find some of it useful!  
* [Here](https://p91g.github.io/patrick-moore.github.io/posts/2023/10/blog-post-data-science-bikeshare/) I explain how data science can be used to solve research problems in bikeshare
* I detail how to scrape bikeshare station availability data [here](https://p91g.github.io/patrick-moore.github.io/posts/2023-06-10-web-scraping-walkthrough-london/) and how to obtain restaurant building locations from the UK gov site [here](https://p91g.github.io/patrick-moore.github.io/posts/2024-02-06-fhrs_extract_notebook/)
* Check out my Python app [here](https://app-built-env-trips.streamlit.app), including visualisation of outlier detection, training a model to predict bikeshare trips and optimising docking station locations using an Evolutionary algorithm.
* Hourly bikeshare trip forecasting, using a Temporal Graph Convolutional neural network is detailed [here](https://p91g.github.io/patrick-moore.github.io/posts/2024-08-01-Predicting_hourly_bikeshare_trips_with_a_Temporal_Graph_Convolutional_Network/)

Interests
------
I am nearing completion of a PhD in Intelligent Transport Systems, focusing on optimising bikeshare operations through analysis of the built environment. The end-to-end machine learning framework was:
1. Automated bike data extraction via stations API,  storing to a SQL database
2. Pre-processed large geo-spatial datasets to extract meaningful metrics
3. Geo-spatial clustering of urban morphology across cities
4. Inference of statistical models to explain determinants of bikeshare trips
5. Predicted future ridership using machine learning (XGBoost) and Random Effects Modelling
6. Discrete optimisation of station locations, using a combinatorial algorithm

Through my PhD, I have nurtured a fascination with understanding the cities we live in, seeking out new ways to capture and analyse geo-spatial data. From performing graph analysis on road networks, to analysing the spatial distribution of buildings, or segmenting city space into distinct clusters, I find excitement in discovering the underlying structures of the urban environment and how people interact with it.

I particularly enjoy bringing data to life visually, whether that be a dashboard, an interactive map or exploring a plotting library. This passion for visualisation enhances my ability to communicate complex spatial patterns and relationships effectively.

While my focus is on transport systems, I've also had exposure to diverse projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning. This breadth of experience has enhanced my adaptability and problem-solving skills.

I primarily work with Python for geo-spatial data wrangling and machine learning, complemented by R for statistical modelling. This combination allows me to leverage the strengths of both languages to tackle different projects.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Intelligent Transport Systems after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.
