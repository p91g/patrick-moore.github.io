**What is covered?**
- On this page I introduce how data science can be used to tackle challenges facing bikeshare schemes 

Bikeshare research
===
Scholarly research into the use of bikeshare schemes (BSS) has grown significantly over the past decade, with great interest in their contribution towards decarbonising transport  off-setting societal health costs  and reducing the number of vehicles needed per person. BSS are a pooled system of bicycles which users hire on a short-term basis for a fee per minute. Increasingly, bikeshare has become a popular form of urban transportation, growing from 16 schemes in 2004 to over 2,000 worldwide in 2021 (see figure 1).

Challenges
===
There are difficulties, however, concerning the _planning, implementation and operational efficiency_ of new and existing schemes. Specifically, is: 
1. the pre-deployment concern of **selecting docking station locations**;
2. the post-deployment requirement of **redistributing bikes** around the system.

These problems remain a complex and ubiquitous challenge for bikeshare operators, impacting the capacity to operate effectively and generate revenue. 

Ultimately, if left unaddressed, they may lead to underuse of a scheme and, in some cases, even result in scheme closure (DeMaio, 2021). Researchers have attempted to develop and implement methods for addressing these issues by utilising: 
- statistical models;
- machine learning algorithms;
- optimisation techniques. 

Data Science Solutions

There are a number of data science methods that can be used address these issues, such as:

- **Regression models** to estimate the demand for bikeshare trips based on various factors, such as weather, time, location, and socio-demographics.
- **Classification models** to predict the availability of bikes or docks at a given station at a given time.
- **Clustering models** to identify patterns of usage and group stations into different categories based on their characteristics.
- **Optimisation models** to determine the optimal number and location of docking stations, as well as the optimal routing and scheduling of rebalancing vehicles. 

You can find out how I have applied data science aproaches to these specific challenges in my individual posts.
