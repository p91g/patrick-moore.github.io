🧑‍💻 I am a PhD graduate of Transportation Data Science

🤖 🗺️ I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly spatial data 

🚲 I have a special interest in cycling research

📚 My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare demand in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I used to visualise, explore and analyse data. I hope that others interested in transportation data science find some of the explanations useful for their research!  

Interests
------
From p-values to deep learning, my experience in visualising, exploring and modelling is wide-ranging. I'm comfortable scraping the web to obtain training data and pre-processing big data, and can provide inference into statistical models and train machine learning models for prediciton. I've also had exposure non-transport projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning.

Through my PhD, I gained an appreciation for flexible modelling techniques as they allow for the most tinkering! Generalised Additive Models featured heavily in my research for the inference side and handling complexities of spatial data. 

On the prediction side, I applied deep learning for the prediction of bikeshare trips and benchmarked against other machine learning (ML) algorithms. I have applied optimisation heuristics to transport data, using both linear programming and genetic algorithms. I particularly enjoy bringing my data to life visually, whether that be an interactive map or a simple bar chart. 

I generally spend equal time between R and Python, with Python typically used for ML and R for advanced statistical models.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Transport Data Science after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.  

Present
------
I am currently taking some time off after graduating, doing a bit of travelling, and exploring opportunities in the data science world shortly thereafter.
