🧑‍💻 I am a PhD graduate of Transportation Data Science

🚲 I have a special interest in cycling research

📚 My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare demand in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I used to visualise, explore and analyse data. I hope that others interested in transportation data science find some of the explanations useful for their research!
