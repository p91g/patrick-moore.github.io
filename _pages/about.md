üßë‚Äçüíª I am a PhD graduate of Transportation Data Science

ü§ñ üó∫Ô∏è I am passionate about visualising, exploring and modelling data, particularly geo-spatial data 

üö≤ I have a special interest in cycling research

üìö My thesis focussed on explaining, predicting and optimising bikeshare use in the UK

What is this site for?
------
I have created this site to host a summary of my PhD research, including the different methods and tools that I have used. Hopefully others interested in the field find some of it useful!  

Interests
------
From p-values to deep learning, my experience in visualising, exploring and modelling data is wide-ranging. 

I have experience with web scraping and preprocessing large datasets. I've also honed my skills with interpreting statistical models, training machine learning (ML) models and applying optimisation algorithms. 

During my PhD, I developed an appreciation for versatile modeling techniques, which provided ample opportunities for experimentation. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) played a large role in my research for inference purposes and in managing the intricacies of spatial data. I am fascinated with comparing the results of statistical models to ML algorithms, exploring both their accuracy and explainability.

To apply my predictive model results, I designed several optimization solutions for the placement of bikeshare stations. I used evolutionary algorithms to improve the system efficiency of station placement, enhancing user demand and accessibility. 

I particularly enjoy bringing my data to life visually, whether that be a dashboard, an interactive map or exploring a plotting library. 

I've also had exposure non-transport projects, such as building a network intrusion classifier using deep learning.

I generally spend equal time between R and Python, with Python typically used for ML and R for advanced statistical models.

Personal
------
Originally from Cambridge, keen rock climber, whippet owner, enjoyer of cooking and brown ale.

Academic & work background
------
I started out in Urban Geography and transitioned into Transport Data Science after researching cycling in the Netherlands, where I obtained my MSc. During my time as a marketing analyst for several years I nurtured my love for data, while getting a handle on business strategy and working with clients.  

Present
------
I am currently taking some time off after graduating, doing a bit of travelling, and exploring opportunities in the data science world shortly thereafter.
